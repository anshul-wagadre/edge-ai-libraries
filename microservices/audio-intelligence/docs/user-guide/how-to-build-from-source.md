# How to Build from Source

Build the Audio Intelligence microservice from source to customize, debug, or extend its functionality. In this guide, you will:
- Set up your development environment.
- Compile the source code and resolve dependencies.
- Generate a runnable build for local testing or deployment.

This guide is ideal for developers who want to work directly with the source code.


## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure the following:
- **System Requirements**: Verify your system meets the [minimum requirements](./system-requirements.md).

This guide assumes basic familiarity with Git commands, Python virtual environments, and terminal usage. If you are new to these concepts, see:
- [Git Documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc)
- [Python Virtual Environments](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)


## Steps to Build

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-libraries.git edge-ai-libraries
    cd edge-ai-libraries/microservices/audio-intelligence
    ```

2. **Install Python 3.10**
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install python3.10
    ```
